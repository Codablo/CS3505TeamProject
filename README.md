Project Overview

This is a school project done Spring of 2013 and consists of two parts.  The first is to take an existing spreadsheet program written in C# the year previous so that instead of being a single user program the spreadsheet would work similar to Google Spreadsheet but not as fancy.
The second part is the creation of a backend server written in c++ for the spreadsheet.  Thus turning the spreadsheet into a frontend program.
